# What is Ruby?

Ruby is a programming language developed in 1993 by [Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto) when he saw a need for a scripting language with object-oriented features baked in from the beginning. Matz has stated many times that his primary goal when creating Ruby was to increase productivity and fun for programmers everywhere. In our opinion Matz has succeeded greatly because Ruby is a ton of fun to learn and even more fun to use in production. Today many popular web applications run on frameworks built with Ruby.
