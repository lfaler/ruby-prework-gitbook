# Exercises

#### The Cookbook App
In the cookbook app you'll take your first stab at structuring a Ruby application. You'll learn about how to properly implement getter and setter methods and how to get objects of different classes to interact with each other.

#### The Power Rangers App
In this exercise you'll continue using objects/instances as method arguments as you did in the cookbook app. You'll be required to take advantage of the concept of *inheritance* and we will learn about `Modules` and `Mixins`.
