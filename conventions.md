# Conventions

A quick note on conventions used in this lesson:
If you see a comment hash followed by a hashrocket everything to the right of the hashrocket is presumed to be the output of that line of code.

<u>Ruby</u>
```ruby
5+9          #=> 14
"lol".upcase #=> "LOL"
```

<u>Console</u>
```console
$ rm -rf /
```

The `$` denotes the console prompt. In reality yours may look something like:

```console
sarahs-macbook: ~ $
```
