# Data Structures

The goal of this chapter is to review the various Ruby data types and data structures. You are likely already familiar with a lot of this and so much of it may be review. We will also be introduced to the Interactive Ruby Shell. IRB, as it is known, is an interactive environment in your terminal where you can evaluate Ruby code. You should already have IRB installed; if you do not go to [ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/). You can check if you have IRB installed by simply typing `irb` into your terminal.
