# Learn Ruby

This is a major work in progress. This initial commit gives you an idea of where the book is going. It will be finished well in time for Cohort 8 to use it for their prework.

This book will teach you the basics of Ruby in order to get you prepared for your first day at MakerSquare. From day one you will be introduced to Test Driven Development and you will learn how to properly architect a Ruby application. Because of this it is imperative that you have a solid understanding of Ruby fundamentals.

This book is mandatory reading for all incoming MakerSquare students.
